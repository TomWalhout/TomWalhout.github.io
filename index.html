            <p>This is a list of information that for once is not presented in a standardized lap of text...</p>

            <h3>Why HBO?</h3>
            <p>The HBO level of education fits me because I have tried studying at Utrecht University last year, but it was just too difficult. I decided to find go study someplace where there's more attention to individuals and more room to have questions
                answered, and so I found HBO-ICT. I believe this study is much more personal than university, and aimed more practically, which is a welcome change.</p>

        <div class="subsec right" id="ICT">
            <h3>Why ICT?</h3>
            <p>I've always been interested in computers. I remember just barely starting high school and already being busy trying to figure out how to write computer programs. <br>Computers are everywhere and they're not going away and time soon. I believe
                being schooled in ICT is one of, if not the best way to prepare for the future. That's the basic reason I started studying ICT.</p>

            <h3>Why here?</h3>
            <p>I grew up with my parents in Lewedorp, lived there until I moved to Zeist to study in Utrecht. As mentioned, that didn't work out and I decided to look for a follow-up study a little closer to home. This study offers me the small stap down
                and the personal guidence I needed while being very close to home.</p><br>

            <h3>Previous Coding Projects</h3>
            <p>This is a list of notable things I've coded in the past, all in C#:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/#frogger">Frogger, but with voice control</a></li>
                <li><a href="/#wh">WorkingHours, which keeps track of... well... the hours I work at my job</a></li>
                <li><a href="/#pong">Pong for four</a></li>

                <p>This is the trailer for "Of Frogs 'n Gods", a game my group made last year, based on frogger. There were seven of us working on it, putting 200 hours each into it over the course of 8 weeks. <br>The idea is to get as far as possible without
                    touching enemies or the water. The real challenge was adding voice control. We found it didn't work to control the frog due to a significant delay, so instead we adjusted the difficulty based on what the user was saying.</p>

                <p>WorkingHours is a quick little console app I wrote that I use to keep track of how many hours I've worked. It's limited in use, but some values like salary can be edited directly in the app. <br>It works by reading and writing timestamps
                    to a file on my computer. I originally wrote it as practise with read/writing to files and as such it did it's job.
