            <h3>Why HBO?</h3>
            <p>The HBO level of education fits me because I have tried studying at Utrecht University last year, but it was just too difficult. I decided to find go study someplace where there's more attention to individuals and more room to have questions
                answered, and so I found HBO-ICT. I believe this study is much more personal than university, and aimed more practically, which is a welcome change.</p>

        <div class="subsec right" id="ICT">
            <h3>Why ICT?</h3>
            <p>I've always been interested in computers. I remember just barely starting high school and already being busy trying to figure out how to write computer programs. <br>Computers are everywhere and they're not going away and time soon. I believe
                being schooled in ICT is one of, if not the best way to prepare for the future. That's the basic reason I started studying ICT.</p>

            <h3>Why here?</h3>
            <p>I grew up with my parents in Lewedorp, lived there until I moved to Zeist to study in Utrecht. As mentioned, that didn't work out and I decided to look for a follow-up study a little closer to home. This study offers me the small stap down
                and the personal guidence I needed while being very close to home.</p><br>
