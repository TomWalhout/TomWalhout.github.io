# HI Y'all

This is asteroids. Or a shitty version of it anyway. Feel free to laugh at how awful the collision is.

## Instructions


1. W to move forward, S to move backwards.
2. A and D are used to rotate your ship.
3. Press SPACE to shoot an incredibly weird plasma laser that definitely does not work properly yet.
4. Shoot the asteroids to win.
5. Get hit to lose.
6. Don't hate the creator, hate the game.

This was made for school and for fun so like, be nice to people on the internet and stuff. Also don't be a thief and make your own homework. Bye!
